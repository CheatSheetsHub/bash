#  Bash 
- Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. 
- First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. 
- Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.
